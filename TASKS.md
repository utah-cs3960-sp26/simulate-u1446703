# Tasks

## Completed — Iteration 16 (2026-03-30)

- [x] Diagnose the current settling regression on this branch:
  - Full test suite was failing 3 settling-focused tests (68/71 passing at start)
  - Headless runs showed residual KE oscillations instead of cleanly reaching zero
- [x] Fix the wall-CCD settling bug:
  - Swept wall contacts now set `inRestingContact` and `inContactThisFrame`
  - CCD wall response now honors `bounceThreshold`, matching the overlap-based wall solver for low-speed contacts
- [x] Add regression coverage for CCD wall contacts rebuilding gravity velocity while pinned to a wall
- [x] Rebuild, rerun the relevant tests, rerun the full suite, and rerun headless verification
- [x] Verify the regression is gone:
  - `./build/tests` now passes **72/72**
  - Headless simulator reaches `KE=0` by frame ~280 at restitution 0.0/0.3 and by frame ~300 at restitution 0.9
- [x] Update docs and append iteration notes to AGENT-PROGRESS.md

## Completed — Iteration 15 (2026-03-29)

- [x] Fix CSV hasColor roundtrip bug:
  - Uncolored balls (hasColor=false) were saved as `0,0,0` and loaded as black (hasColor=true)
  - Now uncolored balls are saved as 4-column rows (ball,x,y,radius) preserving speed-based coloring
  - Updated `csv_save_preserves_ball_color_flag` test to expect new behavior
- [x] Add `applyDefaultConfig()` inline helper in `physics.h`:
  - Applies all `DefaultPhysicsConfig` values to a `PhysicsConfig` struct
  - Simplified config initialization in `main.cpp` (2 blocks) and `color_assign.cpp` (1 block)
  - Reduces per-tool boilerplate from 8 manual field assignments to one function call
- [x] Update `scene_gen.cpp` to use `sim_config.h`:
  - Default container dimensions now derived from `WINDOW_WIDTH`/`WINDOW_HEIGHT`
  - Eliminates risk of dimension drift between scene_gen and the simulator
- [x] Move `physics.h` to include `sim_config.h` directly:
  - All files that include `physics.h` now get shared constants and `applyDefaultConfig()`
  - No circular dependency issues
- [x] Add 6 new tests (64→70):
  - `csv_roundtrip_preserves_uncolored_balls`: mixed colored/uncolored balls survive roundtrip
  - `apply_default_config_sets_all_fields`: verifies all DefaultPhysicsConfig fields applied
  - `apply_default_config_allows_override`: individual overrides after applyDefaultConfig work
  - `csv_load_4_column_ball_rows`: 4-column CSV rows load without color
  - `csv_mixed_colored_and_uncolored_roundtrip`: mixed-format CSV loads correctly
  - `settling_at_three_restitution_values_all_reach_zero_ke`: 100 balls settle to KE=0 at r=0.0/0.3/0.9
- [x] Verify all 70/70 tests pass
- [x] Run headless simulations at r=0.0, 0.3, 0.9 — all reach KE=0
- [x] Verify full color_assign pipeline with new CSV format
- [x] Update documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, BUILD.md, TASKS.md, AGENT-PROGRESS.md)

## Completed — Iteration 14 (2026-03-29)

- [x] Create `sim_config.h` shared header with `WINDOW_WIDTH`, `WINDOW_HEIGHT`, and `DefaultPhysicsConfig`
  - Eliminates SDL dependency for tools that only need the simulation coordinate space
  - `renderer.h` now imports from `sim_config.h` instead of defining its own constants
- [x] Fix `color_assign.cpp` physics config inconsistency:
  - Was using `damping=0.999` (main uses 0.998), `sleepSpeed=2.0` (main uses 5.0)
  - Was missing `solverIterations=8` and `bounceThreshold=30.0`
  - Now uses `DefaultPhysicsConfig` for identical behavior to the simulator
- [x] Fix `color_assign.cpp` hardcoded window dimensions (1200.0f, 800.0f → `WINDOW_WIDTH`, `WINDOW_HEIGHT`)
- [x] Add `# Window: WxH` metadata comment to CSV save for coordinate space documentation
- [x] Add 6 new tests (58→64):
  - `default_physics_config_matches_shared_constants`: verifies DefaultPhysicsConfig stays in sync with PhysicsConfig defaults
  - `csv_save_includes_window_metadata`: checks for window dimension metadata in saved CSV
  - `coincident_balls_do_not_explode`: two balls at identical position resolve cleanly (no NaN/Inf)
  - `color_assign_pipeline_produces_colored_csv`: full scene_gen → headless → color_assign → verify pipeline
  - `high_speed_ball_does_not_tunnel_through_ball_wall`: fast projectile vs ball-wall doesn't tunnel
  - `csv_roundtrip_preserves_walls_exactly`: wall coordinates survive CSV roundtrip
- [x] Verify all 64/64 tests pass
- [x] Run headless simulation — KE=0 by frame ~270 at r=0.3
- [x] Plan and add a checked-in example CSV scene for manual loading/testing
- [x] Create `examples/two_groups_center_funnel.csv` with two mirrored ball groups and a wall funnel/chute into the center

  - 1: reset speed, R: restart simulation, ESC/Q: quit
  - HUD shows KE, speed multiplier, pause state, controls help
- [x] Add 7 new tests (51→58):

- [x] Update documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, BUILD.md, TASKS.md, AGENT-PROGRESS.md)

## Completed — Iteration 12 (2026-03-28)

- [x] Diagnose residual KE plateauing at non-zero values (860K at r=0.0, 995K at r=0.3)
  - Root cause 1: shelf-sliding equilibrium — gravity's slope component balances damping/friction at ~30 px/s
  - Root cause 2: terminal velocity trapping — balls at ~250 px/s against pile, zero net displacement
- [x] Implement contact-aware settling system with two mechanisms:
  - Contact sleep (`contactSleepSpeed=40`): balls in resting contact below threshold zeroed (static friction)
  - Stuck detection (`stuckThreshold=0.1`): per-frame position comparison catches zero-displacement balls
  - Added `inRestingContact`, `prevPos` fields to Ball; `contactSleepSpeed`, `stuckThreshold` to PhysicsConfig
  - Both disabled when `sleepSpeed=0` (for unit tests with precise velocity tracking)
- [x] KE now reaches exactly 0 at all restitution values: r=0.0 by frame 300, r=0.3 by frame 300, r=0.9 by frame 360
- [x] Add ball outlines (0.8px dark border) for visual separation in dense packs
- [x] Add 5 new tests (46→51):
  - `contact_sleep_stops_shelf_sliding`: shelf-sliding balls settle to KE=0
  - `stuck_detection_catches_terminal_velocity_ball`: fast ball against pile zeroed
  - `full_scale_settles_to_zero_ke`: 500 balls reach KE=0 at r=0.0/0.3/0.9
  - `scene_gen_grid_produces_valid_csv`: scene_gen → CSV → loadScene roundtrip
  - `scene_gen_funnel_layout`: funnel layout with extra walls validated
- [x] Adjust settling-invariance test tolerances (15→25-30px) and frames for contact-aware dynamics
- [x] Verify all 51/51 tests pass
- [x] Run headless simulations at r=0.0, 0.3, 0.9 — all reach KE=0
- [x] End-to-end pipeline verified: scene_gen → simulator → CSV save
- [x] Update documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, BUILD.md, TASKS.md, AGENT-PROGRESS.md)

## Completed — Iteration 11 (2026-03-28)

- [x] Implement two-phase sleep system to fix gravity-vs-sleep issue
  - Phase 1 (never-active): counter-based delay gives gravity `sleepDelay` substeps to build velocity
  - Phase 2 (previously-active): instant sleep kills solver micro-vibrations
  - Added `sleepCounter` and `hasBeenActive` fields to `Ball` struct
  - Added `sleepDelay` config parameter (default 8, matching substeps)
- [x] Add 3 new tests (43→46): gravity_wakes_zero_velocity_balls, sleep_counter_resets_on_fast_motion, settling_with_zero_initial_velocity
- [x] Increase shelf scene settling test frames (4000→5000) for counter-based sleep convergence
- [x] Verify all 46/46 tests pass
- [x] Run headless simulations at restitution 0.0, 0.3, 0.9 — all produce valid results
- [x] Update documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, BUILD.md, TASKS.md, AGENT-PROGRESS.md)

## Completed — Iteration 10 (2026-03-25)

- [x] Diagnose 5 failing physics settling tests (38/43 passing at start of iteration)
- [x] Root cause: iteration 9 moved `applySleepThreshold()` from per-substep to per-frame, allowing energy accumulation in dense packings via constraint solver residuals
- [x] Fix: restore `applySleepThreshold()` to run inside the substep loop (per-substep), while also keeping it at frame-end
- [x] Verify all 43/43 tests pass after fix
- [x] Verify headless simulation works (KE decreases from ~850M peak to ~37M after 200 frames)
- [x] Update documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, TASKS.md, AGENT-PROGRESS.md)

## Completed — Iteration 9 (2026-03-23)

- [x] Add `BallColor` struct and `color` field to `Ball` for persistent ball coloring
- [x] Update renderer to use ball's assigned color when `hasColor` is true

- [x] Update documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, BUILD.md, AGENTS.md, AGENT-PROGRESS.md, TASKS.md)
